# Clean the raw data
This function is just a placeholder that returns whatever object you put in.
```{r}
clean_raw_data <- function(raw_data){
  raw_data 
}
```

# Make figure 1
This function takes whatever drake object is called `my_data`, makes the plot, saves the plot (for later upload to a journal), and also returns the plot to the drake cache for pasting into the manuscript.
```{r}
make_fig1 <- function(my_data, output_name){
  p <- ggplot(my_data, aes(Species, Sepal.Length, colour = Species)) + 
    geom_jitter()
  ggsave(p, file = output_name, width = 5, height = 5)
  p
}
```
